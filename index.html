            Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
            Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
            Everything she never had she's showin' off
            Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
            She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
            Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
            We're only gettin' older, baby
            And I've been thinkin' about it lately
            Does it ever drive you crazy
            Just how fast the night changes?
            Everything that you've ever dreamed of
            Disappearing when you wake up
            But there's nothing to be afraid of
            Even when the night changes
            It will never change me and you
            Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin' 'round her head
            He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
            Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
            Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
            She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet
            Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
            We're only gettin' older, baby
            And I've been thinkin' about it lately
            Does it ever drive you crazy
            Just how fast the night changes?
            Everything that you've ever dreamed of
            Disappearing when you wake up
            But there's nothing to be afraid of
            Even when the night changes
            It will never change me and you
            Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
            Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
            Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost
            We're only gettin' older, baby
            And I've been thinkin' about it lately
            Does it ever drive you crazy
            Just how fast the night changes?
            Everything that you've ever dreamed of
            Disappearing when you wake up
            But there's nothing to be afraid of
            Even when the night changes
            It will never change, baby
            It will never change, baby
            It will never change me and you
